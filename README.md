# License-Plate-Geolocator
Our goal is to build a geolocator that can recognize license plates in images/videos in order to aid law enforcement in locating persons of interest.
The first model detects licence plates and isolates them from images/videos
The second model takes the isolated images from the first model and predicts the top X most probable states that a plate is from.
